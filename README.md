# Secure Funding
Clone of [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/), Which is an crowd funding platform for projects, Where creators share new visions for creative work with the communities that will come together to fund them.

In this i'm trying to create a clone of kickstarter by making it more secure and upgrading it to web3.
